## ðŸ§  Group B

1. Write a CPP to implement Online Payment system using function overloading for Online Shopee.  
2. Implement a class Complex which represents the Complex Number data type. Implement the following operations:  
   - Constructor (including a default constructor which creates the complex number 0+0i).  
   - Overloaded operator +, - to add and subtract two complex numbers  
   - Overloaded operator *, / to multiply and divide two complex numbers.  
   - Overloaded << and >> to print and read Complex Numbers.  
3. Implement CPP to demonstrate Exception Handling for Gmail Account Login OR ATM Pin Verification.  
4. Write a C++ program to implement stack of characters and integers using function template.  
5. Implement Virtual function:  
   - Create a base class Employee with a virtual function calculateSalary() returning a base salary (e.g., 1000).  
   - Derive two classes: Manager, overriding calculateSalary() to add a bonus (e.g., 500), and Developer, overriding it to add a project bonus (e.g., 200).  
   - Implement a function that accepts an Employee* and prints the salary by calling calculateSalary().  
   - Finally, create instances of Manager and Developer, and pass them to the function to demonstrate polymorphism, ensuring the correct salary is calculated based on the actual object type.  
6. Implement a function template that finds the maximum of two values of any data type (e.g., integers, floats, strings).  
   - Create a class template Stack that implements a basic stack data structure. The class should support push, pop, as well as checking if the stack is empty.

   - Remove the first and last element from the list  
   - Print the contents of the list after each operation  
   - Implement a function to display all elements of the list  
5. Write a C++ program to write and read data from a file using basic file operations (ofstream and ifstream).  
   - Demonstrate the use of seekg() to move the read pointer to a specific position in the file and display content  
   - Use seekp() to move the write pointer and modify data at a specific position in a file
